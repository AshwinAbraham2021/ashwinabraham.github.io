Hey, you've reached my webpage! You can find some things I've worked on by clicking on the sidebar.
</p>
<p>
In some of the extra time I've had, I've made a short series of puzzles which can be found <a href="./secret">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Most of the content on my website is in the <a href="notes">notes</a> section.<br>
<!-- In particular, <a href="notes/cs-207">CS 207</a> and <a href="notes/cs-251">CS 251</a> are the courses I'm making notes for this semester. -->
</p>

You can also anonymously contact me <a href="https://forms.gle/FqPA4gfSRpakahbTA">here</a>.
