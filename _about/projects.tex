	    $\bullet$ Implemented a modified version of \textbf{latent semantic analysis} which calculates the cosine similarity between different vectors in the covariance matrix corresponding to the data
        
        $\bullet$ Added further functionality for \textbf{reliable detection} if the program is written in C++, Python, or Java for ignoring language-specific syntax

        $\bullet$ Built a user interface using \textbf{Angular} with a \textbf{Django} backend where registered users can upload and process files and view the similarities between the different pairs, visualised as a heat map
	\entry*[2020\phantom{}] \textbf{Tetris} \hfill \emph{Self Project}

        $\bullet$ Developed a complete playable version of the game \textbf{Tetris} in Python using the \textbf{PyGame} library
        
        $\bullet$ Utilized the \textbf{seven-bag algorithm} to reduce flooding and drought of specific pieces
        
        $\bullet$ Implemented an algorithm that analyses the current situation of the game, calculates the best possible move, and makes the appropriate decision to maximise the increase in score
