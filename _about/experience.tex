    \entry*[2021] \textbf{Summer Internship} \hfill \emph{Guide: Navin Goyal $\mid$ Microsoft Research, Bengaluru}
        
        $\bullet$ Working towards proving the \textbf{KLS Conjecture} and \textbf{Hyperplane Slicing Conjecture}, elusive problems in high-dimensional geometry, using the \textbf{(stochastic) localization} method

        $\bullet$ Prepared a \textbf{report} on the topics studied, covering several topics in \textbf{asymptotic convex geometry} from scratch

    \entry*[2022] \textbf{Summer Long-Distance Research Programme} \hfill \emph{Guides: Piyush Srivastava and Hariharan Narayanan $\mid$ TIFR, Mumbai}

        $\bullet$ Working towards bounding the \textbf{mixing time} of the \textbf{coordinate hit-and-run} Markov chain

        $\bullet$ Learnt about 

    \entry*[2022] 

    \entry*[2020] \textbf{Red Plag: Plagiarism Checker} \hfill \emph{Guide: Prof. Amitabha Sanyal $\mid$ IIT Bombay}
	    
	    $\bullet$ Implemented a modified version of \textbf{latent semantic analysis} which calculates the cosine similarity between different vectors in the covariance matrix corresponding to the data
        
        $\bullet$ Added further functionality for \textbf{reliable detection} if the program is written in C++, Python, or Java for ignoring language-specific syntax

        $\bullet$ Built a user interface using \textbf{Angular} with a \textbf{Django} backend where registered users can upload and process files and view the similarities between the different pairs, visualised as a heat map

    \entry*[2021] \textbf{IITB Proc} \hfill \emph{Guide : Prof. Virendra Singh $\mid$ IIT Bombay}
        
        $\bullet$ Developed a \textbf{16-bit processor} using \textbf{VHDL} to execute operations based on instruction format

        $\bullet$ Implemented a \textbf{finite state machine} for the execution of 15 instructions in a \textbf{6-stage pipeline}

	% \entry*[2020\phantom{}] \textbf{Tetris} \hfill \emph{Self Project}

 %        $\bullet$ Developed a complete playable version of the game \textbf{Tetris} in Python using the \textbf{PyGame} library
        
 %        $\bullet$ Utilized the \textbf{seven-bag algorithm} to reduce flooding and drought of specific pieces
        
 %        $\bullet$ Implemented an algorithm that analyses the current situation of the game, calculates the best possible move, and makes the appropriate decision to maximise the increase in score
