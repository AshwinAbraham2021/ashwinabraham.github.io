The link to the notes in PDF is [this](Group_theory.pdf). It is still a work in progress.

Interested readers can find the TeX code for the above in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/amitrajaraman/Group-Theory).

I primarily referred to Dummit and Foote's book titled "Abstract Algebra" while making the above linked notes.
