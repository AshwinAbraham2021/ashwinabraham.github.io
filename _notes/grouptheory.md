The link to the notes in PDF is [this](https://bit.ly/group-th). It is still a work in progress.

Interested readers can find the TeX code for the above in the same repository.

In case you want to access the notes and you're too lazy to come here every time, you can reach them directly at [bit.ly/group-th](https://bit.ly/group-th).

I primarily referred to Dummit and Foote's book titled "Abstract Algebra" while making the above linked notes.
