The link to the report in PDF is [this](/Coding_Theory.pdf).

Interested readers can find the TeX code for the above in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/amitrajaraman/Coding-Theory).

The above report was made as part of the Summer of Science initiative by the Math and Physics Club, IITB.

I primarily referred to Raymond Hill's book titled "A First Course in Coding Theory" and Venkatesan Guruswami, Atri Rudra, and Madhu Sudan's draft titled "Essential Coding Theory" (which can be found [here](https://cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/atri/courses/coding-theory/book/)) while making these notes.
