The link to the notes in PDF is [this](https://bit.ly/auto-th). It is still a work in progress.

Interested readers can find the TeX code for the above in the same repository.

In case you want to access the notes and you're too lazy to come here every time, you can reach them directly at [bit.ly/auto-th](https://bit.ly/auto-th).

I primarily referred to Michael Sipser's book titled "An Introduction to the Theory of Computation" and Hopcroft, Motwani and Ullmann's book titled "Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages and Computation" while making the above linked notes.
